Automate the Boring Stuff With Python Practice and Project Repository

They may or may not be correct, complete, or the simplest "Pythonic" way, but these are the projects I practiced and solutions I found for the practice questions in the book **"Automate the Boring Stuff with Python"** by [Al Sweigart](https://github.com/asweigart)

**UPDATE 9/16:** 
Finally completed both the book and online [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/automate/). This was a great way to learn the foundations of the Python programming language. It also prompted me to start using GitHub.
